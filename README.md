**Dermatological Diagnosis Tool**

\*\*Dermatological Diagnosis Tool\*\* is a deep learning project designed to automatically identify various dermatological conditions from \*\*skin lesion images\*\*, helping doctors and patients achieve faster and more accessible diagnoses.

\---

**Overview**

This project uses a \*\*ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\*\* to classify skin diseases from medical images.    
It demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare diagnostics by assisting in the early detection of dermatological conditions through automated image analysis.
